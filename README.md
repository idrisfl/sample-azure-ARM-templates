# Sample Azure ARM Templates

#### This repository contains some basic ARM templates which allow us to create deployment scripts in Azure. This is the recommended approach by Microsoft so that we can create Azure resources through code as IaC.

###### Many of these are just trials and experiments I did in Azure, both for learning and testing.  

###### Some basic examples for ARM templates are provisioning a VM, creating a Storage blob, mounting a SQL Server Database etc. 


*** Disclaimer: Some of these samples are adapted from the templates available at https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates
