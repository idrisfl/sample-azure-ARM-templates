# Sample Azure ARM Templates

#### This repository contains some basic ARM templates which allow us to create deployment scripts in Azure. This is one of the approaches that can create Azure resources through code (partly also as IaC, although recently Bicep and Terraform are strong contenders). 

###### Many of these are just trials and experiments I did in Azure, both for learning and testing.  

###### Some basic examples for ARM templates are provisioning a VM, creating a Storage blob, mounting a SQL Server Database etc. 


*** Disclaimer: Some of these samples are adapted from the templates available at https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates
